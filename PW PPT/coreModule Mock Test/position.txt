1. Static:
   - Static positioning is the default position for elements, where they follow the normal document flow.
   - Elements with static positioning are not affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties.
   
   -Example:

   <style>
     .static-box {
       position: static;
     }
   </style>

   <div class="static-box">
     This is a static positioned box.
   </div>


2. Fixed:
   - Fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport, regardless of scrolling.
   - The element remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled.
   
   -Example

   <style>
     .fixed-box {
       position: fixed;
       top: 10px;
       right: 10px;
     }
   </style>

   <div class="fixed-box">
     This is a fixed positioned box.
   </div>
 

3. Sticky:
   - Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
   - The element behaves like a relatively positioned element until it reaches a specified threshold, and then it becomes fixed.
   
   -Example

   <style>
     .sticky-box {
       position: sticky;
       top: 20px;
     }
   </style>

   <div class="sticky-box">
     This is a sticky positioned box.
   </div>
  

4. Relative:
   - Relative positioning positions an element relative to its normal position.
   - The element can be moved using top, right, bottom, or left properties.
   
   -Example

   <style>
     .relative-box {
       position: relative;
       top: 20px;
       left: 50px;
     }
   </style>

   <div class="relative-box">
     This is a relatively positioned box.
   </div>
  

5. Absolute:
   - Absolute positioning positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block.
   - The element is taken out of the normal document flow.

   -Example

   <style>
     .absolute-box {
       position: absolute;
       top: 50px;
       right: 50px;
     }
   </style>

   <div class="absolute-box">
     This is an absolutely positioned box.
   </div>
